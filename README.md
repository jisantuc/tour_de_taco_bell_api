Tour de Taco Bell
======

Because everyone should have access to bike routes through many Taco Bells without much effort.

Inspired by [Jeff Zhao's](https://twitter.com/jzhao_9)'s inspiration for getting back on his bicycle.

## Usage

Series of Taco Bell locations can be accessed at

`/tbell_route?address=<your starting place>&desired_route_distance=<how far you want to bike>`

Someday there will also be a `random` route but that doesn't exist yet.
